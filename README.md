# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Project Goal

1. Understand customer behavior - who buys, when, how they pay
2. Identify most profitable segments - cities, categories, customer types
3. Optimize operations - when to staff up, which days are weak
4. Increase revenue - through membership, cross-sales, proper promotion timing


New columns added in [Python code](https://github.com/03LiRiKa03/Retail-Sales-Dataset/blob/main/coding.py) for improved analysis:
- **Hour** - for hourly sales patterns
- **DayOfWeek** - for weekly performance trends
